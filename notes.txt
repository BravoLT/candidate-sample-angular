Notes on test completion

received link from Bill
https://trello.com/c/3DklPIG8/9-0009-frontend-add-edit-and-delete-icons-to-the-user-search-component

cloned app from trello
made github repo for me to save versions to
first commit pushed to remote so I can access on other computers
https://github.com/vladsolokha/user-form-angular

npm i

needed angular cli so in terminal $ npm install -g @angular/cli

googled material.angular.io/components documentation as reference to help build app

https://material.angular.io/components/categories

npm serve

played with the app, to understand problem and see how it functions

created 2 buttons, 'edit' and 'delete' in /src/user/user-search/user-search.component.html
made them different colors according to documentation

received message from Bill saying backend was messed up. 
local port 9999 is not being received by app local port 3200

received a java backend. Make it work by download/install Java 11 and mvn

struggled to figure out Maven installation on Mac; specifically environment variables 
and adding mvn's bin directory of apache-maven to the PATH env variables

Had easier time with windows configuration of the above

But finally, can focus on editing backend and frontend, connecting the two and plugging and chugging.
