/**
 * This file includes polyfills needed by Angular and is loaded before the app.
 * You can add your own additional polyfills to this file.
 *
 * This file is divided into 2 sections:
 *   1. Browser polyfills. These are applied before loading ZoneJS and are sorted by browsers.
 *   2. Application imports. Files imported after ZoneJS that should be loaded before your main
 *      file.
 *
 * The current setup is for so-called "evergreen" browsers; the last versions of browsers that
 * automatically update themselves. This includes Safari >= 14, Chrome >= 87 (including Edge-Chromium),
 * and Firefox >= 78. Edge < 87 does not support the `brotli` algorithm, so it is left out here.
 *
 * Load zone.js and the zone.js patch before other angular dependencies.
